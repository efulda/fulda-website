Hi! I am a PhD student in the NIH Oxford-Cambridge Scholars Program, a joint program between the National Institutes of Health and the University of Oxford. I am interested in exploring associations between physical activity and disease with respect to reverse causation. This work will leverage data from wrist-worn accelerometers and genomics from large biobank cohort studies, including the *All of Us* Research Program and the UK Biobank.
